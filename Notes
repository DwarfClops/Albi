======================== ANOTATIONS =============================================================
- After making annotations you have to make neg and pos txt files
- neg txt contains images with bad data
- pos txt containts images with good data and the position of the data (x1,y1,x2,y2)
- Super Anotate produces a json file with the photo data that you have selected
- CIRCLES, DEGREES, RADIANS
-- CIRCLES
--- all points in the same plane that lie at an equal distance from a center point
--- Area = πr^2
-- DEGREES (ANGLES)
--- 360 degrees in one Full Rotation
--- Why 360 degrees?
---- 360 can be divided EASILY into smaller portions
--- part of a circle is called an arc
-- RADIANS
--- The angle made when the radius is wrapped round the circle, like degrees
--- To go from degrees to radians: multiply by π, divide by 180
--- To go from radians to degrees: multiply by 180, divide by π
